# Basic concepts
## 1. Tabulation (Categorized) vs Memoizatation (Mermorized)

These are 2 different ways to store values that the values of a problem can be resused.

1. __Tabulation__: Bottom up. It's like to calculate Fibonacci(N) by store an array of calculated values.
2. __Memoization__: Top down. It's like calculate Fibonacci(N) by the formular: Fibonacci(N) = Fibonacci(N-1) + Fibonacci(N-2) with initialized Fibonacci(0) = Fibonacci(1) = 1;


Tabulation seems to be faster, but memoization needs less code and looks simpler.
